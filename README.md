# 555-soil-moisture-snsr-cal
CLI calibration program for those cheap 555 timer based capacitive soil
moisture sensors.
Intended to be ran on Raspberry Pi with a BC Robotics 16-channel analog
multiplexer HAT.

01-19-2025 Very much under construction. Just reading values from a couple text
files, until I can get ahold of some actual hardware to do this with.
Binary is only compiled for AMD64 at this time, it will not run on your RPi,
yet.
